- 👋 Hi, I’m Ish and welcome to my little portfolio of things!

- 👀 I’m interested in bioengineering, and love all things about the body.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
      - Cradiovascular Modelling
      - Physiological Modelling
      - Regulatory requirements of Medical Devices
      
- 💞️ I’m open to collaboration with anyone, let's have a chat!

      
Enjoy!
